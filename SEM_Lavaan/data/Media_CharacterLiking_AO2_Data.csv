Along with this, the bones in his hand (later become blades) come out of his hand and are used as claws. Typically speaking, the violence we see in the comics of Wolverine is fairly gruesome. However, this was dulled down for most of the movies that have come out, until this past one, Logan, in which we really see the brutality that is parallel in the comics.
